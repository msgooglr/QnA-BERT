The Shoshone leader Washakie had a preference for the area, and had previously defeated the Crow in battle to hold the territory. As early as 1862, Indian Agent Luther Mann Jr. recommended creating a permanent reservation for the Shoshone. After prospectors discovered gold at South Pass in 1867, the United States Indian Agent sought to limit numerous tribes from raiding mining camps by placing the Shoshone reservation in the Wind River Valley as a buffer. The United States hoped that tribes like the Crow, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Lakota, and Arapaho would attack their traditional Shoshone enemies instead of the miners. However, the area was too dangerous for the Shoshone to occupy year-round, so Chief Washakie kept his people closer to Fort Bridger for several years after 1868.	0

If you haven’t heard about Saturna Island before, we are home to 350 year-round residents, as diverse as we are colourful– retirees, young families, artists, politicians, entrepreneurs, designers, farmers, builders, socialites and recluses. The people of Saturna are very welcoming, and work tremendously hard to throw awesome events– such as the annual Lamb BBQ, biannual Pig BBQs and Prawn Fest– for locals and visitors alike to enjoy. Nearly half of Saturna Island is protected within the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve which boasts a network of spectacular hiking trails and beaches to entice any traveler. For example, East Point’s lighthouse park is known as a premiere terrestrial whale watching destination, with orcas, humpbacks, and porpoises visiting year round. If you arrive to the island on-foot and are worried about getting around the island to see the sights, don’t fret! We have an amazing island-wide ‘Car Stop’ program (where locals will pick you up at any of the designated stops and drop you off as close to your destination as possible). The Saturna Lions Club also offers a free community shuttle, which meets weekend ferry sailings in the summer season, and is available on an on-call basis the rest of the year.	0
