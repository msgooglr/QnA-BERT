"The Shoshone leader Washakie had a preference for the area, and had previously defeated the Crow in battle to hold the territory. As early as 1862, Indian Agent Luther Mann Jr. recommended creating a permanent reservation for the Shoshone. After prospectors discovered gold at South Pass in 1867, the United States Indian Agent sought to limit numerous tribes from raiding mining camps by placing the Shoshone reservation in the Wind River Valley as a buffer. The United States hoped that tribes like the Crow, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, Lakota, and Arapaho would attack their traditional Shoshone enemies instead of the miners. However, the area was too dangerous for the Shoshone to occupy year-round, so Chief Washakie kept his people closer to Fort Bridger for several years after 1868."	0

"If you haven’t heard about Saturna Island before, we are home to 350 year-round residents, as diverse as we are colourful– retirees, young families, artists, politicians, entrepreneurs, designers, farmers, builders, socialites and recluses. The people of Saturna are very welcoming, and work tremendously hard to throw awesome events– such as the annual Lamb BBQ, biannual Pig BBQs and Prawn Fest– for locals and visitors alike to enjoy. Nearly half of Saturna Island is protected within the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve which boasts a network of spectacular hiking trails and beaches to entice any traveler. For example, East Point’s lighthouse park is known as a premiere terrestrial whale watching destination, with orcas, humpbacks, and porpoises visiting year round. If you arrive to the island on-foot and are worried about getting around the island to see the sights, don’t fret! We have an amazing island-wide ‘Car Stop’ program (where locals will pick you up at any of the designated stops and drop you off as close to your destination as possible). The Saturna Lions Club also offers a free community shuttle, which meets weekend ferry sailings in the summer season, and is available on an on-call basis the rest of the year."	0

"Six years ago, we opened Hawker Bar to bring new flavors, fun dishes, and a new approach to making Singaporean and South East Asian street food to the Ossington and Dundas neighborhood. We’ve been touched by the diversity of people that have come through our doors, enjoyed our food and, in the process, helped to contribute to Toronto’s culinary scene. With that being said, we also know that all things must change! We’ve decided to close Hawker Bar to give us a chance to explore new, different opportunities far and wide. . We’d like to thank everyone who’s supported us over the years, through our struggle to get a liquor license to the expansion to our second floor. We’d also like to thank all of our staff, including our invaluable chef, Alec Martin, for making sure we run a tight ship and put out a good product. We could never have made Hawker Bar without them! . Sunday April 29th will be our last day of service so we invite everyone to come and grab a Hawker Laksa, Singapore Wings, and say bye to our staff before we close! We’ll still be taking reservations until April 29th, which you can grab online at bookenda.com, email us at hawkerbar@gmail.com, or call 647-343-4698. . love, Andrew Mistry Nicholas Laliberte Frederic Laliberte Casimir Alyea . >For any media or specific enquiries, email us at hawkerbar@gmail.com . . . . . #hawkerbar #hawker #ossington #westend #toronto #torontolife #torontorestaurants #torontoeats #toronto_insta #torontofood"	1

"college system in Canada both as an educator and as an administrator from the early 1950s right through to his retirement in 1999. He also contributed greatly to the field of linguistic studies, most notably for the Prince George region, through his 1960-1961 examination of the Carrier language in the Nadleh Whuten (Nautley – Fort Fraser) Reserve on Fraser Lake in Northern B.C. R.J. Baker began his career in education as a lecturer (1951-1955; 1957-58) in the Department of English at the University of British Columbia (UBC); eventually advancing to the positions of Assistant Professor (1958-63) and Associate Professor (1963-65). It was during his UBC tenure in the 1960s that Ron Baker was asked to became one of the chief contributors to John B. Macdonald's report, “Higher Education in British Columbia and a Plan for the Future” (The University of British Columbia: 1962) This report led directly to the government's decision to establish a second university- Simon Fraser University- in the Lower Mainland. On November 14, 1963, the newly established Simon Fraser University (SFU) hired R.J. Baker as its first Director of Academic Planning. After assuming his duties on January 1, 1964 he went on to became the head of SFU's English Department on December 10, 1964: a position he held from 1964-1968. Throughout his SFU tenure, R.J. Baker also served on the provincial Academic Board for Higher Education, established to advise the government on applying the recommendations of the 1962 Macdonald Report. *In 1969, Ron Baker left Simon Fraser University to become the first President of the University of Prince Edward Island, a post he held for nine years. On July 4, 1978 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for his contributions to higher education. In addition to his work in British Columbia and Prince Edward Island, he was a long-time member of the Board of Directors of the AUCC, served the maximum period allowed on the Canada Council and was the President of the Association of Atlantic Universities. He was also President of the Association of Canadian University Teachers of English and the Canadian Society for the Study of Higher Education, and served on the executives of the Canadian Linguistic Association and the Canadian Council of Teachers of English. In January 1990, he was asked by the government of British Columbia to write a preliminary report on the establishment of a university in the northern part of the province – a university eventually established as the University of Northern British Columbia. Dr. Baker has since retired and now lives in Surrey, British Columbia. [*excerpt from Ron Baker fonds, Appendix: “Autobiographical Sketch” by R.J.
